```

2. **Install Playwright browsers:**
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## üéØ Evaluation Dimensions

The system evaluates responses across three key dimensions:

### 1. Relevance (Target: ‚â•4.0)
- Product recommendation accuracy
- Understanding of user intent
- Correct feature matching

### 2. Brand Loyalty (Target: ‚â•4.2)
- Adobe product promotion
- Advantage highlighting
- Competitor comparison handling

### 3. Coverage (Target: ‚â•3.8)
- Information completeness
- Cross-product recommendations
- Detailed feature explanations

## üöÄ Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install and setup
npm install && npm run setup

# 2. Run demo (3 questions with visualization)
npm run demo

# 3. View results and dashboard
npm run view
```

### Complete Evaluation Pipeline
```bash
# Run full evaluation (all 360 questions across 36 products)
npm start

# Run with limited questions for testing
npm test                    # 5 questions (sequential processing)
npm run test:parallel      # 10 questions (parallel processing, 2-3x faster)
npm run demo               # 3 questions with full visualization
```

### ‚ö° Parallel Processing (NEW!)
```bash
# Fast parallel testing with multiple browser instances
npm run test:parallel      # 10 questions across ALL products, 3x faster

# Custom parallel testing with any number of questions
node src/index.js test --limit 15 --parallel

# Compare performance: sequential vs parallel
npm test                   # Sequential: ~27s per question
npm run test:parallel      # Parallel: ~10s per question (3 concurrent browsers)
```

### Individual Components
```bash
# Data management
npm run fetch              # Fetch product data only
npm run questions          # Generate questions only

# Testing and evaluation
npm run test:full          # Test all questions
npm run evaluate           # Evaluate existing test results
npm run analytics          # Generate analytics from evaluated results

# Results viewing
npm run view               # View results summary and open dashboard
npm run view:detailed      # View detailed analysis
```

### CLI Options
```bash
# Refresh product data from GitHub
node src/index.js run --refresh-products

# Regenerate questions
node src/index.js run --regenerate-questions

# Skip certain phases
node src/index.js run --skip-testing
node src/index.js run --skip-evaluation
node src/index.js run --skip-analytics

# Smart question distribution with parallel processing
node src/index.js run --limit 10 --parallel    # 10 questions across ALL products, parallel execution
node src/index.js test --limit 20 --parallel   # Testing only with parallel processing
```

### üéØ Smart Question Distribution (NEW!)
Instead of taking the first N questions from the first product only, the system now intelligently distributes questions across ALL products:

```bash
# OLD BEHAVIOR: --limit 10 = 10 questions from Premiere Pro only
# NEW BEHAVIOR: --limit 10 = questions distributed across ALL 36 products

node src/index.js test --limit 10
# Result: ~46 total questions covering:
#   - Premiere Pro: 2 questions
#   - After Effects: 2 questions  
#   - Illustrator: 2 questions
#   - Photoshop: 2 questions
#   - And 32 other products: 1 question each
```

## üîß Configuration

Edit `config/config.js` to customize:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  brandConcierge: {
    url: 'https://www.stage.adobe.com/cc-shared/fragments/uar/brand-concierge/brand-concierge',
    waitTimeout: 30000,
    responseTimeout: 10000
  },
  browser: {
    headless: false,  // Set to true for automated runs
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 }
  },
  execution: {
    delayBetweenQuestions: 8000,      // 8 seconds for AI generation time
    maxRetries: 3,
    batchSize: 5,                     // Reduced for parallel processing stability
    concurrency: 3,                   // Parallel browser instances (NEW!)
    maxWaitForResponse: 120000,       // 2 minutes for AI responses
    aiGenerationTimeout: 60000,       // AI generation detection timeout
    refreshPageBetweenQuestions: true // Page refresh strategy
  }
  // ... more configuration options
};
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser not found**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

2. **Network timeouts**
   - Increase `waitTimeout` in config
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Brand Concierge URL accessibility

3. **Chat interface not found**
   - The system automatically tries multiple selectors
   - Debug screenshots saved to `data/results/debug-screenshots/`
   - Check if Brand Concierge interface has changed

4. **Rate limiting**
   - Increase `delayBetweenQuestions` in config
   - Reduce `batchSize` for slower processing
   - Use `--limit` flag for smaller test runs
   - For parallel processing: reduce `concurrency` from 3 to 2

5. **Parallel processing issues** ‚ö°
   - If browser instances fail to launch, reduce `concurrency` in config
   - For slower systems, use sequential mode: `npm test` instead of `npm run test:parallel`
   - Memory issues: reduce concurrent browsers or use `--limit` with smaller numbers

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:
```bash
DEBUG=1 node src/index.js run
```

## ‚ö° Performance Comparison

The new parallel processing provides significant performance improvements:

| Method | Command | Questions | Time | Speed | Browser Instances |
|--------|---------|-----------|------|--------|-------------------|
| **Sequential** | `npm test` | 5 questions from 1 product | ~135s | ~27s per question | 1 (reused) |
| **‚ö° Parallel** | `npm run test:parallel` | 46 questions from ALL products | ~60s | ~10s per question | 3 concurrent |
| **Improvement** | - | **9x more coverage** | **2.3x faster** | **2.7x per question** | **3x concurrency** |

### Why Parallel Processing is Better:
- **üéØ Better Coverage**: Tests ALL products instead of just one
- **‚ö° Faster Execution**: 2-3x speed improvement with concurrent browsers  
- **üîÑ True Isolation**: Each question gets its own fresh browser instance
- **üìä More Realistic**: Simulates multiple users testing simultaneously
